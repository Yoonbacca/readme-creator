This is a Readme Creator designed by Yoon-Jae Kim. The purpose of this program is to generate a professional README using the CLI. After running 'node index.js', the user will be put through a series of prompts using the inquirer module. After answering each question, a new README file will be created in the readme-folder directory. Methods used here were learned from NW Coding Bootcamp.
